# Personal Music Page
***
This will be a personal music page that includes my bio, gigs, compositions, lessons, and a contact form. I choose this because I had content ready and it felt like a good starting point in my coding journey. It will be created using html, css, and javascript. 

## Media Queries
***
Located at the bottom of the style.css file. Includes a mobile-first approach with two breakpoints for medium screens and larger screens. 

## CSS Features
***
- The site will include a navigation menu that will be a clickable icon for mobile devices but turn into a visible navigation menu for medium and larger devices. This is found in nav.css.

- Both Flexbox and CSS Grid were used to organize content areas based on mobile and desktop views. This is found in the style.css file.

## JavaScript Features
***
- A form will be created so a user can send me there email and explain why they want to contact me. The information they submit will be displayed back to them. Found in validate.js.

- When a user clicks the music img it will become much larger. An additional click will return the img to its original size. Found in modal.css and modal.js.

- The navigation menu will be clickable for mobile devices. Found in nav.js.
